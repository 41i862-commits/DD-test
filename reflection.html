            <h1>My Growing Pain</h1>
            <div class="respond">One thing I struggled with most during coding was when the website didn't work, I couldn't find
the part that had issues, and many times I struggled with not knowing which function represents
what symbol. When the website doesn't work, I'll try to find if there are misspell word or structure
issues, if still can't find the issue I will ask teacher or friend for help. I learned how to use visual
code to code and using github to make the website. The part of pushing to github is the most
difficult because I didn't know how it works.

                Do you feel that now if you use ChatGPT or Gemini to help you code, you know more of how or what to ask it?
            </div>
            <p>
                Yes, I feel more confident using ChatGPT or Gemini to help me code.
Before this project, I did not know what questions to ask and often felt confused by the answers.
Now, after learning HTML and CSS, I understand basic structure and layout,
so I can ask more specific questions about Flexbox, Grid, and styling.
